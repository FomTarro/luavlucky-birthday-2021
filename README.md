# Happy #Lua1stAnniBirthday! 

This web app was made for beloved VTuber creative Lua V. Lucky as a gift for her combination Anniversary and Birthday in 2021!

## What is it?

This web app is a simple hourglass timer. Hold your device upright to have the timer start ticking. Flip the deive upside down to reverse the count (also works on desktop with a button instead of gravity).

I hope you are able to use this as a timer for your exercise sets, for keeping track of how long you're doing chorse for, or just general productivity (like a pomodoro timer).

## What is it made of?

This web app is a dead-simple vanilla JS/HTML page, with no backend. No need to overcomplicate things. As such, if you wanted to yoink these and host them somewhere else, you'd only need what's in this repo.

HAPPY ANNIBIRTHDAY, LUA! You are genuninely one of the coolest people I've met.
