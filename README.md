# Happy #Lua1stAnniBirthday! üéâ

This web app was made for beloved VTuber creative Lua V. Lucky as a gift for her combination Anniversary and Birthday in 2021!

You can try it here: https://www.skeletom.net/gifts/lua-birthday-2021/

## What is it? ‚è≥

This web app is a simple hourglass timer. Hold your device upright to have the timer start ticking. Flip the deive upside down to reverse the count (also works on desktop with a button instead of gravity).

I hope you are able to use this as a timer for your exercise sets, for keeping track of how long you're doing chorse for, or just general productivity (like a pomodoro timer).

## What is it made of? üß∞

This web app is a dead-simple vanilla JS/HTML page, with no backend. No need to overcomplicate things. As such, if you wanted to yoink these and host them somewhere else, you'd only need what's in this repo.

## Closing remarks üí≠

HAPPY ANNIBIRTHDAY, LUA! You are genuninely one of the coolest people I've met in this space. I look forward to seeing what incredible creative endeavors you bring to the scene in your next year of activity.
